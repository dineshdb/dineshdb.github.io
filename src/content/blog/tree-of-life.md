Wrote it on a rainy day, at least four years ago.

***

Does the tree feel more pain <br/> or the branch that falls off? <br/>
does bark feel the same pain <br/> when it peels off?

will it forget their existence <br/> when another takes its place? <br/>
or will it remember being more,<br/> the sum of all that came before?

does it mourn the fallen that came before <br/> or those that might fall next summer? <br/>
or should it rejoice that it has lived long <br/> or should it just reach to live on

does it know what it means to be wise<br/>who am I to tell
otherwise? <br/>
