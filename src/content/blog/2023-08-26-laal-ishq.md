I just read an article on how having consistent rhythm is important in
[finishing projects](https://github.com/readme/guides/finish-your-projects). I
struggle with finishing projects. Something irks me from finishing it properly.
I fail at saying proper goodbye. I fail at proper closing.

The author mentions how he goes on
[repeating the same song](https://twitter.com/aarondfrancis/status/1419361671760564231)
again and again to get him back to the zone. The rhythm would set his mood and
let him get back to the project.

I'm going to try the same.
[Laal Ishq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEH3Aev0uME) will be my song for
sometime that I will keep on repeat. I would think of my projects when I listen
to this song and keep working on them. This way, I will keep making progress.
