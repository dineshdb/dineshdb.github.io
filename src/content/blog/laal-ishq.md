I just read an article on how having consistent rhythm is important in [finishing projects](https://github.com/readme/guides/finish-your-projects). I struggle with finishing projects. Something irks me from finishing it properly.
I fail at saying proper goodbye. I fail at proper closing.

The author mentions how he goes on [repeating the same song](https://twitter.com/aarondfrancis/status/1419361671760564231) again and again to get him back to the zone. The rhythm would set his mood and let him get back to the project. 

I'm going to try the same. [Laal Ishq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEH3Aev0uME) will be my song for sometime that I will keep on repeat. I would think of my projects when I listen to this song and keep working on them. This way, I will keep making progress.
