<pre class="poem">
why does it feel so freeing 
to let go of things i considered so dear
like i clutched them too hard 
pressed against my chest -- into my heart

dreams, anxiety and fear
of my worst nightmares 
to see them happen right before me
can't even close my eyes, forced to see

now that nothing remains
anger course through my veins
sense of clarity pour on me
like there is nothing more to see

yet rock bottoms are stacked
more i dig, more i find
when i cage myself under so deep
a weird sense of confidence creep

no choice but to climb, or die
either way, i don't cry
i have no more tears to spare
I let go of things once i held so dear
</pre>
