<pre class="poem">
Bitten
too many times
more than I can count
trust comes no more
even when it should

Scared
of being let down
I don’t expect much
anymore

Refused
are my feelings
at locked doors
and guarded hearts
no refuge left

Bruised
by constant beating
each ever so slight
you wouldn’t notice

</pre>
