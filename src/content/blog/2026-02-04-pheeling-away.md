<pre class="poem">
Every ... day
i give part of me away
bit by bit
until i barely feel like myself

Haven't felt for a long time now,
i don't regret doing so
i've been hollowing
tearing away the rotten flesh
till only bones remained 

Days, weeks, months drift by
i keep shedding without fail
will i rise anew or will i decay away
only the time will tell

Still, i keep going 
not because i want --
i have no choice,
with slimmer hope
one day i will rejoice 
for the new me
for the struggles i won

if you get to see that man
say hi, greet him warm
though i wish to see him myself
alas, i shall be long gone
</pre>
