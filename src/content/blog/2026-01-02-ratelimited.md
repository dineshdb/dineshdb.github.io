<pre class="poem">
Dumbfounded right
before i speak
a few words that
i love you more
than anyone
even
myself

Can't tell
i
trust you
to
keep me
safe

too much
rain
pouring in
my heart
drenched
with emotions
panicked, overwhelmed

yet here i am
right
before you
speechless
wordless
but not
worldless

trust you to
keep me safe.
</pre>
