I started my journey into Linux as my main OS last decade, sometime in 2013. I
started with Cinnamon. I used it for couple of years. It must be around 2015
when LMDE 2 was being developed when I finally settled with Fedora and GNOME
after going through dozens of distro-hopping and trying out different DEs.

<aside>
I became a Mozillian in 2017. I used Firefox as my main browser in the beginning. Then I switched to Chrome for its speed and compatibility and FOSS was not my concern at all. I was only interested in extracting value from what was available and not giving back. I was kind of dumb and selfish back then. I liked Linux only because it was much better than Windows at that time. I hadn't worked with MacOS at all (when I did, I installed Linux on it. It was Intel MBP and it's a long story). So for me, Linux was the **BEST** OS and that's why I chose it. With time, I started caring about FOSS philosophy, I learned more and switched to Firefox purely out of philosophy. At that time, Firefox was preparing to release Fission and I downloaded the beta version to try it out. Later, I downloaded nightly and have been riding the nightlies as my main browser ever since.

## No more GNOME

I'm not saying this out of spite or hatred. GNOME is a good desktop and I love
it. I like the simplicity. I like the aesthetics. I like that its snappy and I
don't need to tinker much to get it going.

<aside>
When I tried KDE, I loved that I could configure every aspect of it. I would go days configuring KDE but as I went through the churn of distrohopping, I realized -- software was a tool and a tool should be more useful and should get out of the way and yet provide some customizability. Even then, it should not try to be overly customizable and try to do everything. That's why I like apps and tools that have clearly defined and yet can be integrated together. Unix in a nutshell.
</aside>

However, I'm falling in love with something else: COSMIC. It's new and shiny.
Well that's primarily it. But also it's so much closer to GNOME, something I
love. I also love that it's written in Rust. Apart from the usual benefits of
Rust: speed, performance, safety; I'm more interested because the code will be
simpler due to it sitting on the shoulder of giants and I will be contribute
back.

<aside>
Back in 2016/17, I wanted to contribute back to GNOME and I tried to learn
Vala since I didn't really like C. I thought writing apps in javascript wasn't
that good either, though I could have been wrong on this. However, I got
distracted by another SHINY tool: Rust. I stopped learning Vala and started
learning RUST. I didn't contribute back to GNOME after that. Right now, I think
I might be able to since COSMIC is exactly at that spot.
</aside>

I'm not planning on doing regular contributions and all that. But even if I can
contribute to COSMIC occasionally, that's better than nothing. Not only that,
but also, I'll be more comfortable knowing I will be able to tweak the code
instead of waiting for someone else, just the feeling I felt when moved from
Windows to Linux.

## GNOME no more?

This is my radical thought - Will GNOME not exist anymore? Not immediately but
say in 5-10 years. I can see this happenning. If COSMIC get to the place where
it is aiming to be, a set of tools for developing any kind of DE, would it be so
easy to make a GNOME on top of COSMIC and its tools? Would it make more
maintanable that GNOME, in its form would feel like legacy? I can see that
happening in next 5 years. I already feel it today but I can see more people
feeling it this way with time.

<aside>
With Linux Foundation announcing 'Supporters of Chromium Based Browsers' group,
I can see the same happening with Firefox in next 10 years.
But I don't think that would be a good idea, unlike in GNOME's case.
I would love Firefox to innovate more and do its own thing better.
But for GNOME, would love them to collaborate more with this new **SHINY**
 thing and join forces. Anyway, they don't have to listen to me :sigh:.
</aside>

## Farewell?

I'm not at that stage yet. However, I've been running Cosmic Alpha 4 since last
month and it has been mostly stable for the most part. I only had to login with
GNOME once, and because it lost my audio devices and wouldn't show my headphone
and monitor mic and speakers in the audio selector. And that was once.

Other than that, COSMIC session wouldn't start. I create a second user and see
if COSMIC was broken. It wasn't. Must have been my configuration. I think an
update wasn't compatible with my previous configuration and it broke without me
changing anything. ALPHA SOFTWARE :hehe:.

Today, they released Alpha 5 and I'm not that excited because I daily check
their logs and update my system daily with my Universal Blue image. I already
knew most of these changes and had already been using them.
