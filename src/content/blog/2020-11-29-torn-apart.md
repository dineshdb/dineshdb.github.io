Wrote it when I was still struggling from the pain, so that my mind could
believe me.

---

Torn apart... <br /> from the very existence, <br /> to be an accessory to you -
<br /> no longer my existence <br /> belongs to me.

Was I longing for you, <br /> unsure, incomplete <br /> I can no longer
continue, <br /> or so I tell myself

I let go of you. <br /> It makes no difference to you, and no sense to me.
