Wrote it when I was still struggling from the pain, so that my mind could
believe me.

<pre class="poem">
Torn apart...
from the very existence,
to be an accessory to you -
no longer my existence
belongs to me.

Was I longing for you,
unsure, incomplete
I can no longer continue,
or so I tell myself

I let go of you.
It makes no difference to you, and no sense to me.
</pre>
