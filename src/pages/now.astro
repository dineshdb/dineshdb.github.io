      <h2>My current goal is</h2>
      <p>
        to create a secondary source of income that doesn't require me to be
        consistently present all the time. Bank interest and stock-markets don't
        cut it because I want to get more involved but not as much as my day
        job.

      <h2>Learning:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Swimming: I'm a self-taught beginner. I practice at National Sports
          Center, Chysal regularly in the morning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Biking: Learning to ride my petrol-scooter(<i
            >I know, I should have gone with the electric one</i
          >). I know the basics and have ridden about 1400km of distance but
          that doesn't make me comfortable for highly dangerous scenarious and
          emergency braking. I want to be a pro at it. Would love some pointers
          or trainers.

          ðŸ˜³. It's a real **struggle**.
